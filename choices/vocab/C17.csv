  ""notes"": ""Trieste II was originally certified to operate under submerged stay-times that were limited to eight hours. However, scientists have recorded stay-times that reached 24 hours. She has been changed, improved and redesigned so many times that almost no original parts remain. The most recent changes were made in June 1971, when her hull number was changed to DSV 1, and in May 1984, when she was assigned to Submarine Development Group 1. She was moved to Keyport in 1985.""
