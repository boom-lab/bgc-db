# Argo Database Backend
Back end for http://argo.whoifloatgroup.org

Using primarily Django, this back end serves data for the front end of the site, but also is used for managing metadata,
tracking inventory, distributing data to partners, and all other interactions with the database.

The backend is deployed on AWS's Elastic Beanstalk, which can be updated using the EB CLI
